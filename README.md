# DUDE
DUDE is a framework for firmware binary decryption, unpacking of various filesystem formats, deobfuscation of obfuscated magic signatures, and endian conversion of big endian cramfs. Moreover, it also provides support for a custom filesystem format which is not supported by the existing toolkits.
